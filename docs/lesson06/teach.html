      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>For your team activity this lesson, you'll review your teammates e-commerce web applications.<br>
         In most computer science or software engineering careers, you'll be asked to review the work of your peers and give feedback.
         For this review, you'll want to consider what requirements are met for the
         <a href="./prove.html">Prove 06</a> assignment.
      </p>
      <p>The final application should contain functionality for:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>
               Store Product CRUD (Create, Read, Update Delete) operations using Mongoose Schemas or a similar external backend (e.g. Firebase)</br>
               This means a user can:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>Add a product to the store.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Edit products they have added to the store.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Remove products they have added to the store.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The user <strong>cannot</strong> remove or edit product's submitted by another user.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               Authentication methods are used to:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>Sign users up for the website</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Log existing users into the website</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Send a confirmation email to a newly created account's email.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Prevent duplicate accounts (email is always unique)</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Prevent access to administrative web endpoints of other users (CRUD operations for products).</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Prevent rendering of administrative web endpoints in the navigation bar given the user is not signed in.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the applications produced may not be totally unique in purpose, some of your teammates may choose
         to go above and beyond. Basically, these are features that were not covered in the preparation material.
         Such features could include:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Optimizing the CSS for both mobile and desktop browsers.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>A unique and professional looking CSS layout.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Utilizing AJAX requests through JavaScript rather than &ltform&gt actions/methods.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Adding extra fields to database items, such as stock quantity, and associated features (orders decrement item stock, users cannot purchase more than the available stock).</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>User has the ability to decrement the quantity of a certain item in a cart.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>User has the ability to decrement the quantity of a certain item in a cart.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Make sure to list feedback in a comprehensive and constructive manner.</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>Positive features (if any) with reasonable explanations as to why they are good should be listed first.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Negative features (if any) with reasonable explanations as to why they are bad should be listed second.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Finally, each negative feature should contain a recommendation for improvement.</p>
