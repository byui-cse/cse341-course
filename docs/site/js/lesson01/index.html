        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Lesson One of CSE 341!</p>
        <p>This lesson is an exciting introduction to the course. We will be learning about the course, getting to know each other, creating cloud platform accounts, setting up our development environments, and following the time honored "Hello World!" tradition by creating an HTML file and deploying it to an application in the cloud.</p>
        <p>Remember to take the time to visit the "Weekly Developer Forum" discussion topic often to both ask and answer questions. We can all learn from each other. We have students from a number of different majors. You will quickly find that you already have experience and knowledge that could be of great benefit to your fellow classmates.</p>
        <p>Let's get started...</p>
