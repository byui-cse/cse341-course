        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ul>

        <p>Teams is a team communication service that we'll be using for this class. It's like a chat room, but with a lot of extra features that make it ideal for software teams. Many major organizations use Microsoft Teams for their team communications.</p>

        <p>The instructor will set up a Teams organization for this course, and provide instructions about accessing it. You are encouraged to download the desktop application but may also download the mobile application to stay more connected. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app" target="_blank">Download Microsoft Teams</a>. If, after downloading Teams and logging in with you BYU-Idaho email, you do not see the team for your class, please contact your instructor with your byui email.</p>

        <h3>Teams Channels</h3>
        <p>Communication in Teams is divided into channels. Most of our class-wide communication will happen in the General channel.</p>

        <p>Once teams have been established, private team channels will be created for each team to use.</p>

        <p>In addition, you can send direct messages to your instructor (or to other students). In fact, if you have a pressing question about something, you can often get a response faster by sending a direct message to the instructor on Teams than by emailing. Teams is also very nice for calling people or groups with audio and video.</p>

        <h3>Teams Etiquette</h3>
        <p>It's important to be professional in your online communications. Aside from the standard guidelines of not using ALL-CAPS TO COMMUNICATE and speaking respectfully, you should be aware of <a href="https://www.maxsum.com/blog/microsoft-teams-etiquette-the-dos-the-donts-the-did-you-knows/" target="_blank">Teams-specific etiquette</a>.</p>
