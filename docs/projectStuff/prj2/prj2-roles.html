      <h1>Teamwork</h1>
      <p>In industry, virtually all development projects are completed in teams. In these teams, each member operates in well-defined roles. For a team to reach its potential, each team member must know the role in which they are assigned as well as know how to support others operating in different roles. While there certainly is redundancy built into this system, it is important to note that every team member has a shared responsibility for the project.</p>
      <h2>Roles</h2>
      <p>Each team has the following roles: lead, Q/A, editor, and contributor. While you may choose to specialize in one of these roles by the midpoint of the semester, it is expected that some role changing will occur periodically.</p>
      <h3>Lead</h3>
      <p>The team lead oversees the project and coordinates the activities of the individual team members. The lead performs the following activities:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p><b>Determining team status:</b> The leads spend a significant amount of time collecting information from the team members and sending information back to the team members. This is a difficult and non-trivial process; one does not just wait for information to come &emdash; you need to seek it out. The lead should be in "constant" communication with the team members, having daily conversations. This will consume perhaps 20% of the lead’s time (about an hour a lesson).</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><b>Communicating with the instructor:</b> Questions about the project funnel to the instructor through the lead. The most effective leads will be thinking a lesson ahead of the rest of the team, getting clarification about the project from the instructor a lesson before everyone else. This way, the lead can be ready to answer questions as they come without delay. Most leads will schedule a 5 to 10-minute meeting with the instructor every lesson.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><b>Work on the project:</b> The team lead will contribute to the work of the project. Do to his or her other responsibilities, he or she will only be able to do about 75% of the work of the rest of the team. This means the lead will spend about 4 hours a lesson directly contributing to the project.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To be effective in this role, the lead needs to possess excellent communication skills. He or she also needs to greatly value the contribution and time of the rest of the team. Meetings should be short and well planned. Questions should be answered quickly. Communications should be clear and to the point.</p>
      <h3>Q/A</h3>
      <p>The quality assurance engineer (Q/A) has two main jobs on the project: to understand expectations and to find defects. The Q/A performs the following activities:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p><b>Evaluate the quality of the project:</b> The Q/A makes it his/her job to fully understand the expectations for a given deliverable. This is accomplished two ways. First, the Q/A carefully reads the instructions with special emphasis on how it is graded. Second, once a submission has been graded, the Q/A checks the instructor’s evaluation with the Q/A’s own assessment. If there is any difference, the Q/A contacts the instructor for clarification. Thus, the Q/A should be able to give the team a clear idea of the overall quality of the project at a given point in time. This takes about 20% of the Q/A’s time, about an hour a lesson.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><b>Find defects in the project:</b> Of course, the Q/A wants the highest possible grade for the project. This means the Q/A is constantly looking for defects. With every submission on the part of the rest of the team, the Q/A will look for things which may decrease the grade. Note that it is not the Q/A’s job to fix the defects. Instead, it is to point them out. When the defect is fixed, then the Q/A verifies the fix and accepts it. This is a big job, taking a full 80% of the Q/A’s time (4 hours a lesson). The Q/A typically has no time left to directly contribute to the project.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To be effective in this role, the Q/A needs to be detail oriented. He or she needs to be tenacious, not stopping until the best possible work is submitted. He or she needs to be a clear communicator, completely and precisely communicating expectations and flaws in such a way that the rest of the team can take appropriate action. Finally, the Q/A needs to be diplomatic. He or she needs to criticize the work but never the individual producing the work.</p>
      <h3>Editor</h3>
      <p>The deliverable every lesson will be a document. The editor assembles this document from the various sources and produces the final submission. The editor performs the following activities:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p><b>Determines the workflow:</b> The editor chooses the technology that will be used to produce the final document, the format of the edits coming from the team, and how revised copies of the work are distributed to the rest of the team. As the editor will probably not get this exactly right the first try, the editor constantly evaluates the workflow to make the process more efficient and less problematic. This takes an hour a lesson for the first couple lessons but consumes little of the editor’s time by halfway through the course.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><b>Makes formatting decisions:</b> All documents are communication tools that must relate the ideas of the authors to the readers. The editor decides how best to use various formatting tools to make the document more readable.<br> Though the editor will certainly get feedback from the Q/A about formatting choices, final formatting decisions are made by the editor.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><b>Assembles the document:</b> Though some editors may choose to allow all members of the team to have access to the final document, most will choose to assemble the document themselves. This serves to guarantee a higher degree of consistency and professionalism in the document. The editor usually spends two hours a lesson assembling the document.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><b>Work on the project:</b> The editor will contribute to the work of the project. Due to his or her other responsibilities, he or she will only be able to do about 50% of the work of the rest of the team. This means the editor will spend about 2 to 3 hours a lesson on the project.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To be effective in this role, the editor will have above-average writing skills and an appreciation for document aesthetics. Good editors also tend to be tinkerers, always looking for better ways of doing things.</p>
      <h3>Contributor</h3>
      <p>Most members of the team will serve as a contributor. These people produce most of the content for the project with the assistance of the other roles. The contributor performs the following activities:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p><b>Evaluate, design, and code:</b> The contributor evaluates various options for completing his or her assignment, looks for the best possible design, and implements design decisions in the code.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><b>Serves as a resource to others:</b> Each contributor should constantly be on the lookout for opportunities to help other contributors or the various specialists. The overall health of the project is always the highest priority, this being more important than any specific assignment.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><b>Easy to work with:</b> Each contributor seeks to be less of a burden on the lead, the Q/A, the editor, and the other contributors. When a contributor realizes he or she has created extra work for another, he or she takes immediate steps to ensure this does not happen again.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To be effective in this role, the contributor needs to be friendly, proactive, and reliable.</p>
