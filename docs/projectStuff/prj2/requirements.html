        <h1>Final Project Requirements</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For the last chunk of the semester we will be building the backend of a web applications using Node.js and MongoDB. </p>
        <h3>Basic Guidelines</h3>
        <p>One of the strengths of Node.js is its ability to expose web services which can then be consumed by client-side AJAX. </p>

        <p>Along these lines, your project will be a full stack Node.js project that uses Web Services for the communication between the client and the server.</p>

        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
        <p>For this project, you are to create an application of your choosing (you will decide with your teams). If interested, <a href="./ideas.html">here</a> is a list of some applications that other students have developed.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>The following rubric will apply specifically to your project as a whole. Each person in your team will receive a grade partially derived from the project grade, and partially from their own participation. These expectations and grading specifics can be found <a href="./teams.html">here</a>.</p>
