        <h1>Project 2 High-level Tasks</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Your team assignments for the second half of the semester are very flexible in how you implement them.</p>
        <p>To avoid falling behind, and to ensure successful and timely delivery of your project, it is recommended that you consider how you will spread out the work throughout the duration of the project.</p>
        <p>Many developers prefer to begin building the frontend of an application, while many others prefer to start with the database, then web services. You have the flexibility to create your application in the way that you decide with your team. The following are tasks in any application that will need to take place. You may choose to implement one per lesson depending on your preference, or in any other way that your team decides.</p>
