                            After having created your first project, you are ready to branch out and apply all that you have learned up to this point. For the remainder of the course, you will work on another project in a team that will account for the majority of your grade in this course.

                            While working on your first project, you used git to track changes and push your code to Heroku. Now that you're working with a team, you'll have to do a little more than just add, commit, and push. You'll likely want to work on different features on their own branches, and merge finished features into your main branch. Because you're working on a team, you'll also have to deal with merge conflicts, and need to know how to resolve them.

                            Git is a valuable skill that will be useful to you in other classes, as well as in internships and jobs in the future. To help you gain a better understanding of how git works and how to use it, here are some resources about using git and GitHub:

                            Project architecture will vary from what was learned in the first part of the semester in some ways. For example, students will deploy a backend REST API that will allow another project (like a web frontend, mobile app, wearable app, etc.) to retrieve data. Helpful tips and information are including below in <code>Project 2 Resources</code>. It is very common in industry to see teams of frontend developers and teams of backend developers writing code in two different repositories, but that pertain to the same web application as a whole.

                        <p>
                            You are only responsible for the backend Node.js API project.

                            Campus students: more often than not, our class will team up with students from WDD330 Web Frontend Development II. They build the frontend, and we build the backend. This does not change your project requirements or expectations at all.
