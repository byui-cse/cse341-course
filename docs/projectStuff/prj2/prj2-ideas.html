        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For the second half of the semester we will be building web applications using Node.js. You are encouraged to develop something that will be useful, or something that interests you personally. </p>
        <p>If you cannot think of an app to create, you should ask friends, family, or co-workers to see if they have a website they need developed, or have always you to see become a reality.
