      <h1>Teamwork Contribution Requirements</h1>
      <p>Your grade on the final team project will be a combination of the project grade and your individual
         contribution.
         You submit your team ranking here,
         each team members multiplication factor will be computed based on the rankings,
         and your final grade on the team assignment will be a product of your multiplication actor and the assignment
         grade.</p>
      <h2>Short version of how grades will be computed</h2>
      <p>The following spreadsheet is read-only. You cannot edit it, but you can view it to see how your overall grade for the project will be computed. The spreadsheet used to compute the multiplication factor (student participation * project grade) and an individual's score is here: <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i4UUcSjnKiKAPoGs3gnK2a5-8uIg7SHENZIlEWLgghQ/edit?usp=sharing">TeamAssessment Google Sheet</a>. <code>You will need to sign in with your BYU-I credentials to view it and you will not be able to edit it directly. To edit it and insert your own numbers to give you an idea of projected grades, you may click File > Make a Copy from the Google Sheet and then you can modify your own copy.</code></p>
      <h2>Long version of how grades will be computed</h2>
      <h4>Team Ranking</h4>
      <p>Order the members of your team from the most valuable to the least valuable.
         There are several ways to look at this:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Who did the most work? Who did not pull their weight?</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Who accomplished the most difficult task? Who was only able to do the easy stuff?</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Who was easiest to work with? Who brought unneeded drama to the team?</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Who was most reliable? Who failed to deliver?</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each member of the team must submit a contribution ranking.
         Any member who fails to submit a ranking will be placed at the bottom of the order.
         Every ranking must also contain all the members of the team;
         no one can be left out (including you!).
         Please list everyone by their full name.</p>
      <p>If a member of your team did not participate in the assignment, please indicate with a note saying <b>* Did not
            participate *</b></p>
      <p>Additionally, please list what you think the spread of performance is.
         If everyone contributed roughly the same, then say the spread is "Low".
         If there were a few superheros and/or a few non-contributors, please say the spread is "High."
         Otherwise, I will assume the spread is "Medium" or average.</p>

      <h4>Multiplication Factor</h4>
      <p>An individual's multiplication factor will be computed based on his or her individual combined ranking score.
         A multiplication factor of 1.0 means the individual will receive the assignment score as his or her individual
         score.
         A multiplication factor of 1.1 means the individual will receive 110% of the assignment score.
         For example, if the assignment score was 90%, then a 1.1 multiplication factor will give the individual a
         reported score of 99%.
         Finally, a multiplication factor of 0.8 means the individual will receive 80% of the document score.
         For example, if the assignment score was 90%, then a 0.8 multiplication factor will give the individual a
         reported score of 72%.</p>

      <h3>Computing the Multiplication Factor</h3>
      <p>The multiplication factor will be computed the following way:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>One point will be given for the individual at the top of the rank, two for the next person, and so on.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>All the points will be totaled for each person on the team.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Based on the lowest possible total (6pts for a 6-person team) and the highest possible total (36pts for a
               6-person team),
               a point spread will be determined (30pts for a 6-person team)</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>An individual's score minus the lowest possible value times divided by the spread will yield the ratio.
               Note that 0.0 is best possible ratio, 0.5 is the average, and 1.0 is the worst.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Based on the individual's ratio and the score spread (130%-70%), a multiplication factor will be computed
               for each student.
               Thus, the best possible multiplication factor will be 1.30 and the lowest will be 0.70.
               A student who has an average rank will have a multiplication factor of 1.00.
               Note that a team consisting of individuals with a similar point tally will have ratios between 1.10 and
               0.90.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>An individual's reported score will be computed by multiplying the student's multiplication factor by the
               assignment score.</p>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>If this is confusing, don't worry!
         The point is that the the best contributors will get a higher score.
         Also, when there is a consensus as to an individual's performance (such as everyone agreeing that an individual
         did not take part),
         then there is a greater spread in the scores. You can make a copy of the spreadsheet above to see how grades will look based on participation.</p>

      <h4>Strategies</h4>
      <p>There are two ways to get a high score for the assignment: either be a high-ranking member of the team or
         produce a high quality assignment.
         In both cases, working harder will result in a higher score and slacking off will result in a lower score.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>You can get a high score on the assignment even if you are part of a low performing team because it is
               easier to be at the top of the ranking in a low performing team.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>You can also get a high score on the assignment even if there are other high performers on the team who
               outperform you on the team ranking
               because the overall assignment score will be high.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In every scenario
         In other words, you will always get the score you deserve and working harder will always result in a higher
         score.</p>
