    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>For the team activity this lesson, you will be downloading the class file organization
      template. You will also learn how to start local development using your localhost
      (i.e localhost:5000). While the team activity for this lesson has already been completed
      in the template, it is expected that you and your team thoughtfully look over and discuss the code.
    </p>
    <p>Below are steps to use a class template for file organization that will make your life a
      lot easier:</p>
    <ol>
      <p>Download the zip file of the class template. The template can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/byui-cse/cse341-project">cse341-project</a></p>
      <p>A few steps to complete the installation:</p>
      <li>
        <p>Assure that you are currently in the cse341-project folder when you type in the following commands</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the terminal type <code>npm install express --save</code>. This will install all the necessary files needed to use express.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the terminal type <code>npm install nodemon --save</code>. While not necessary 'nodemon' allows for your localhost server run again every time your files are saved.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In order to start up a localhost session either type in <code>nodemon</code> if you installed nodemon or <code>npm start</code> if nodemon was not installed</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Type <code>localhost:5000</code> in your browser url (This is a local workspace for you to test your code)</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once you have dowloaded the template complete the following steps with your team:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Navigate to the ta01.js file found in the routes folder</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Together with your team thoughtfully examine the code</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Assure that all members of the team understand what the code is doing. To do this, ensure that you all can answer the following questions confidently.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>What is the res object?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What does res.write do?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What is the routes directory used for?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What is the views directory used for?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What is the public directory used for?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If your team is unsure about any one of these questions, please post on the #help channel in Microsoft Teams.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Finally, you're going to save all of this code in a new, personal repository on github. If you would like to use a graphical user interface like <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens">GitLens</a> you may. Here, you will learn how to use git commands to complete this.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Having completed the steps in the <a href="setup.html">the course setup</a> at the beginning of this lesson's reading, you know how to create a new repository in github.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Create another new repository. This repository you will build on with each team activity and many assignments throughout the semester.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After having created it in github, on your computer in this folder with the downloaded code, you will start a new git project, add the remote of the new repo in github, then add, commit and push all of your code to it. Some helpful commands are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><code>git init</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>git remote add</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>git remote -v</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>git add</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>git commit</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>git push</code></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Debugging NodeJS</h2>
    <p>The last task for today is to debug your Node project. This will be an extremely important skill to master for anytime you work with Node. Please watch this video to learn how to debug here in VS Code:</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" class="img-tutorial" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HtiigX7wHC4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Now that you've learned how to debug, put a breakpoint into your project, and start debugging your project. Answer the following questions with your team:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>What is the <code>launch.json</code> file?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do you set a breakpoint?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do you view all breakpoints?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How do you see all variables with their values while debugging?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How does this differ from debugging in the Chrome developer tools?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What is the call stack? When might it be useful to access the call stack?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
