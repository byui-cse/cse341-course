        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>For the team activity this week, you will be downloading the class file organization
          template. You will also learn how to start local development using your localhost 
          (i.e localhost:5000). While the team activity for this week has already been completed
          in the template, it is expected that you and your team thoughtfully look over and discuss the code.
        </p>
        <p>Below are steps to use a class template for file organization that will make your life a
           lot easier:</p>
        <ol>
          <p>Download the zip file of the class template. The template can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/byui-cse/cse341-project">cse341-project</a></p>
          <p>A few steps to complete the installation:</p>
          <li><p>Assure that you are currently in the cse341-project folder when you type in the following commands</p></li>
          <li><p>In the terminal type <code>npm install express --save</code>. This will install all the necessary files needed to use express.</p></li>
          <li><p>In the terminal type <code>npm install nodemon --save</code>. While not necessary 'nodemon' allows for your localhost server run again every time your files are saved.</p></li>
          <li><p>In order to start up a localhost session either type in <code>nodemon</code> if you installed nodemon or <code>npm start</code> if nodemon was not installed</p></li>
          <li><p>Type <code>localhost:5000</code> in your browser url (This is a local workspace for you to test your code)</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you have dowloaded the template complete the following steps with your team:</p>
        <ol>
           <li><p>Navigate to the ta01.js file found in the routes folder</p></li>
           <li><p>Together with your team thoughtfully examine the code</p></li>
           <li><p>Assure that all members of the team understand what the code is doing. To do this, ensure that you all can answer the following questions confidently.</p></li>
           <li><p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>What is the res object?</p></li>
              <li><p>What does res.write do?</p></li>
              <li><p>What is the routes directory used for?</p></li>
              <li><p>What is the views directory used for?</p></li>
              <li><p>What is the public directory used for?</p></li>
            </ul>
           </p></li>
           <li><p>If your team is unsure about any one of these questions, please post on the #help channel in Slack.</p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>Finally, you're going to save all of this code in a new, personal repository on github. If you would like to use a graphical user interface like <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens">GitLens</a> you may. Here, you will learn how to use git commands to complete this.</p>
         <ol>
           <li><p>Having completed the steps in the <a href="setup.html">the course setup</a> at the beginning of this week's reading, you know how to create a new repository in github.</p></li>
           <li><p>Create another new repository. This repository you will build on with each team activity and many assignments throughout the semester.</p></li>
           <li><p>After having created it in github, on your computer in this folder with the downloaded code, you will start a new git project, add the remote of the new repo in github, then add, commit and push all of your code to it. Some helpful commands are as follows:
             <ul>
               <li><p><code>git init</code></p></li>
               <li><p><code>git remote add</code></p></li>
               <li><p><code>git remote -v</code></p></li>
               <li><p><code>git add</code></p></li>
               <li><p><code>git commit</code></p></li>
               <li><p><code>git push</code></p></li>
             </ul>
            </p></li>
         </ol>
