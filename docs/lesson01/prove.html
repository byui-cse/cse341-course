        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>After completing the assigned reading for the lesson and your team activity, you are prepared to complete your personal assignment. Your assignment will consist of completing the assignment found in <a href="https://pro.academind.com/courses/767386/lectures/13901622">Understanding the Basics</a> from the tutorial videos. You will then publish your completed code to a personal GitHub repository. This will help you learn how to work with git, data, pages, and client-server communication.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Complete the <a href="https://pro.academind.com/courses/767386/lectures/13901635">Assignment - Basics (Problem)</a> from the Academind tutorial by doing the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>In the main directory of the project template you downloaded during the team activity, create a new file called prove01.js and 
                spin up a Node.js-driven server running on port 3000. (Just ignore the additional folders and files in the project for now.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Create another file called prove01-routes.js that can handle two routes: "/" and "/users"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Return a greeting message on the "/" route</p></li>
                    <li><p>Return a list of dummy users on the "/users" route</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p>In the "package.json" file included with the project, add a new startup configuration called "prove01" to the "scripts" section that will run your prove01.js file using nodemon. (Hint: Add "prove01": "nodemon prove01.js" under "scripts")</p>
            <p>You'll need to start your project by typing <kbd>npm run prove01</kbd> in the terminal.</p></li>
            <li><p>On the "/" page, add a &lt;form&gt; with a "username" &lt;input&gt; that is submitted using a POST request to "/create-user" when the submit button is clicked</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the "/create-user" route to routes.js and parse the incoming data from the form submission, then display it in the console.</p>
            <p>In order to get 100%, in addition to displaying the submitted data in the console, update the list of users on the /users page.</p></li>
            <li><p>Be sure to use nodemon                                               </p></li>
            <li><p>Push your code up to Github. </p></li>
