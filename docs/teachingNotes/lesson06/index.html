                <p>As students are finishing up their projects this lesson, help them understand what they should do anytime they are finishing up a project or any piece of software. Here are some ideas of things to share with them.</p>
                <h3>How do I know when my app is done?</h3>
                <p>While there are always ways to add on to a project that we have worked on, there are also things that should always be done before our apps are published for wide-spread use.</p>
                <h4>Performance: Pass Google Page Speed Insights Test</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Plug the site into Google PageSpeed Insights to see your results</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If the site requires login / credentials, login to the site first and check the performance with <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pagespeed-insights-with-p/lanlbpjbalfkflkhegagflkgcfklnbnh" target="_blank">Chrome Page Speed Insights Extension</a></p>

                <h3>Class Activity</h3>
                <p>The class activity this lesson is going to be a little different. The only programming they will have to do is to simply insert a valid db connection string. Outside of that, they will simply use this project to gain experience in refining a project. The following zip file can be distributed to your students. It has tasks in it instructing them regarding what they should do. This activity will be best in teams or individually. After a given amount of time, bring the class together to talk about what could be improved in the project and what the different test results were like from the links provided them in this lesson.</p>

                <h2>Instructor Preparation</h2>
                <p>This lesson is all about finishing up our e-commerce applications. As the students follow along with the reading/videos of the Academind course, they will basically complete everything in the rubric to be able to get a 93%. With that said, they need to go above and beyond, and implement some type of functionality that is unique to their application. In this lesson's prove assignment, there is a <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse341-course/lesson06/prove.html" target="_blank">video</a> with some ideas of how they could go above and beyond. Encourage them to view this as they clean up their projects and prepare them for the final submission.</p>
                <p>After this project is complete, we will still continue in the Academind course, though the feel will be quite a bit different. Up until this point in the course, students have been extremely reliant on the Academind course to complete their assignments. The remainder of the semester will not be like that. Their projects will primarily encorporate what they have learned up to this point, and dive deeper into these principles, and they will continue to learn and do assignments that will help them in their careers.</p>
