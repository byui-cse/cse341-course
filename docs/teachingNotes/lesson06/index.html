                    <li><p>E-commerce projects are due at the end of this week. Ensure your students are aware that to get 100% on the project they need to have implemented functionality above and beyond what they have done in the Academind course.</p></li>

                <p>As students are finishing up their projects this week, help them understand what they should do anytime they are finishing up a project or any piece of software. Here are some ideas of things to share with them.</p>
                <h3>How do I know when my app is done?</h3>
                <p>While there are always ways to add on to a project that we have worked on, there are also things that should always be done before our apps are published for wide-spread use.</p>
                <h4>Performance: Pass Google Page Speed Insights Test</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Plug the site into Google PageSpeed Insights to see your results</p></li>
                    <li><p>If the site requires login / credentials, login to the site first and check the performance with <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pagespeed-insights-with-p/lanlbpjbalfkflkhegagflkgcfklnbnh" target="_blank">Chrome Page Speed Insights Extension</a></p></li>
                    <img src="lesson06_01.jpg" alt="" class="img-tutorial">
                    <li><p>Another useful tool is <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/" target="_blank">Pass GTMetrix Analysis</a></p></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Security</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Use HTTPS only. HTTP should always redirect to HTTPS.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Qualys SSL Server Test - Aim for a score of A and above</p></li>
                    <li><p>Consider these free / open source scanning tools (among others): Qualys, OpenVAS, Nmap, OSSEC, Security Onion, OpenSSH</p></li>
                    <li><p>All inputs are validated on the server before processing</p></li>
                    <li><p>All input data is encoded before sending the response to the browser</p></li>
                    <li><p>Web server directory listing has been disabled</p></li>
                    <li><p>CSRF tokens are included in all requests that change state</p></li>
                    <li><p>Errors shown to users or on the client do not contain stack traces, source code, full paths or any other internal data.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Content type of uploaded files is always verified before uploading.</p></li>
                    <li><p>If XML files are handled, external entity is disabled and DTD processing enabled</p></li>
                    <li><p>HTTPS is used and Strict-Transport-Security is sent.</p></li>
                    <li><p>TLS 1.2 or higher required</p></li>
                    <li><p>Session cookies set Secure, HttpOnly and SameSite-lax attributes</p></li>
                    <li><p>All other cookies set Secure and if possible, HttpOnly also</p></li>
                    <li><p>All 3rd-party libraries that the app uses are updated to the latest version</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Authentication Security</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Passwords are stored using strong cryptography (PBKDF2, HMAC-SHA256, bcrypt)</p></li>
                    <li><p>The password is required to change any account information</p></li>
                    <li><p>Passwords require at least 12 characters and reject at least the most common 1000 passwords</p></li>
                    <li><p>Multi-factor authentication is supported</p></li>
                    <li><p>The number of attempts to endpoints such as login, password reset, and 2FA validation is restricted and monitored. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Language libraries are used to create and validate JWT tokens</p></li>
                    <li><p>When a user logs out (or when a session expires), the session on the server is destroyed and JWT tokens associated with it are invalidated</p></li>
                    <li><p>The password reset token is destroyed after use or after expiration.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Broken Links</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Check that all pages get no broken links on <a href="https://monkeytest.it/" target="_blank">Monkeytest</a></p></li>
                    <li><p>Check that all pages get no invalid links on <a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/" target="_blank">Screaming Frog</a></p></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Compatibility</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Check compatibility with major desktop browsers and their versions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer)</p></li>
                    <li><p>Check mobile browsers too!</p></li>
                    <li><p>Also, check how Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android) perform on various screen sizes.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>SEO / Social</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Is it fetched correctly by Google? (Check with <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/" target="_blank">Google Webmaster Tools</a>)</p></li>
                    <li><p>Is it in the first page of Google Search Results Pages (SERPs)?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Does it contain correct OpenGraph tags for social sharing? Test by dropping the link into Facebook / Twitter / Pinterest to see what image, title, and description is generated</p></li>
                    <li><p>Does the site or app have the correct Title / Meta Description Tag?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Does it have a Favicon?</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Nice to Haves</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Validate HTML/CSS with <a href="https://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org</a></p></li>
                    <li><p>Check basic Web Accessibility with WAVE or with tools at <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/" target="_blank">https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/</a></p></li>
                    <li><p>Are the 404 pages informative?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Does your site need a <a href="https://github.com/cognitom/paper-css" target="_blank">print stylesheet</a>?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Make sure your JavaScript is error free when your page loads (check from Google Chrome’s Developer Tools)</p></li>
                    <li><p>Are the URLs reasonable/descriptive? Reasonable URLs helps visitors and search engines understand your content.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Does Canonical domain work? (www.abc.com vs abc.com, and so on)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Class Activity</h3>
                <p>The class activity this week is going to be a little different. The only programming they will have to do is to simply insert a valid db connection string. Outside of that, they will simply use this project to gain experience in refining a project. The following zip file can be distributed to your students. It has tasks in it instructing them regarding what they should do. This activity will be best in teams or individually. After a given amount of time, bring the class together to talk about what could be improved in the project and what the different test results were like from the links provided them in this lesson.</p>

                <h2>Instructor Preparation</h2>
                <p>This week is all about finishing up our e-commerce applications. As the students follow along with the reading/videos of the Academind course, they will basically complete everything in the rubric to be able to get a 93%. With that said, they need to go above and beyond, and implement some type of functionality that is unique to their application. In this week's prove assignment, there is a <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse341-course/lesson06/prove.html" target="_blank">video</a> with some ideas of how they could go above and beyond. Encourage them to view this as they clean up their projects and prepare them for the final submission.</p>
                <p>After this project is complete, we will still continue in the Academind course, though the feel will be quite a bit different. Up until this point in the course, students have been extremely reliant on the Academind course to complete their assignments. The remainder of the semester will not be like that. Their projects will primarily encorporate what they have learned up to this point, and dive deeper into these principles, and they will continue to learn and do assignments that will help them in their careers.</p>
