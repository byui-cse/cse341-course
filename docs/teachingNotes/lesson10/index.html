                <p>Important topics to teach your students this week. These topics will come primarily from the reading and should contain information that will help them with their assignments. </p>
                <h3>Goals for this week</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Encourage students to continue with their project plan</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Teach the following concepts</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>CRUD Operations in a REST API</li>
                            <li>JWT Authentication</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>CRUD Operations in a REST API</h3>
                <p>Not much will change for using CRUD operations in an API. The only real difference is that responses contain JSON data instead of a rendered page. Most of the logic will be the same as earlier in the course.</p>
                <h3>JWT Authentication</h3>
                <p>Because REST APIs are "stateless," we don't store sessions in our API server. We need a way to do stateless authentication. This is where JSON web tokens (JWT) come in.</p>
                <h4>What is JWT?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Tokens are generated by the server.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Token is stored on the client and sent with every request.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Tokens can only be validated by the server. Changes to the token will be detected by the server, so tokens can't be faked.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Tokens contain JSON data and a signature. The JSON data can be decoded by the client, but only the server can verify the signature.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How Authentication Works</h4>

                <h3>Class Activity</h3>
                <p>To help students gain experience working with JWT authentication and to help them implement authentication in their projects, here is a class activity. The following zip file can be distributed to your students. It has tasks in it instructing them regarding what they should do. This can be done in a class setting as a group, in teams, or individually.</p>

                <h2>Instructor Preparation</h2>
                <p>This week is all about creating and working with REST APIs. The material this week will be especially relevant to teams working with WDD 330, since they are essentially writing a REST API for their team projects.</p>
                <p>Help students to understand how REST APIs are used, and how they enable a single backend to be used by mulitple frontends (web app, mobile app, desktop app, etc.).</p>
