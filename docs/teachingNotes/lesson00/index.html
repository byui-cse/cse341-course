        <h1>Lesson 00 - Course Setup</h1>
        <h2>General Setup for Instructor</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Complete the Instructor Pre-Semester Checklist that Online Instruction emailed to you. You will receive this email shortly before the semester begins.</p></li>
            <li><p>Ensure that your Instructor Profile is updated with your office hours, Zoom URL, and other information.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Course Specific Setup for Instructor</h2>
        <h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
        <p><code>Create a Microsoft Teams team for your course</code>. This is where the majority of communication will take place instead of I-learn discussion boards or email. You will use your BYU-Idaho email to create the team for your course, then it will be easy to invite your students to your team because they will all have Microsoft accounts with the university. Here are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/get-started-with-teams-create-your-first-teams-and-channels" target="_blank">some instructions</a> on how to create a team in Microsoft Teams if you have not done it before. 
        </p>
        <p>Online courses are monitored by Teaching Group Leads (TGLs) to ensure that students are having a great experience. One of the items these leads look to see is that instructors are having good discussion with the students. In most courses this occurs in I-Learn discussion boards, so the TGL may not be aware of the Microsoft Teams discussions. To help keep them in the loop, after announcing Microsoft Teams to the students and adding them to the team via their byui email address, please also invite the TGL to join.</p>
        <h3>I-learn Setup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li><p>The course uses an online <a href="https://academind.com/" target="_blank">Academind</a> course for the textbook. Students do not need to purchase the <a href="https://pro.academind.com/p/nodejs-the-complete-guide-incl-mvc-rest-apis-graphql" target="_blank">course at full price</a>. An agreement has been made with Maximilian Schwarzmüller that allows students direct access to the course link via I-Learn Auto Access. Ensure that this resource is present in your course.</p></li>
            <li><p>Adjust the gradebook settings in Canvas. The <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse341-course/syllabus.html" target="_blank">syllabus</a> states that 20% will be taken off the grade for each day that an assignment is late. You may configure your gradebook settings to be similar to the following: </p></li>
            <img src="lesson00_1.jpg" alt="Canvas gradebook settings" class="img-tutorial">
            <li><p>The final project (13 Teach: Final Project Submission) should be due in lesson 13, at the beginning of the last class period of lesson 13. If you are in an online section, just ensure that the final project is due at the end of lesson 13. If you are in an on-campus section, ensure that the project is due at the beginning of class on that last class day of lesson 13, then that time in class can be spent doing project presentations and everyone can see the projects of one another on this last day of class.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Welcome Email</h2>
        <p>Send a welcome email to your students to establish expectations and initiate your desired learning environment. Please ensure your email contains the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>A welcome to the class, including information about when the class will start and an explanation of how to access the course.</p></li>
            <li><p>An invitation to reserve 3–4 hours each lesson per credit to devote to their studies. Time should be reserved throughout the lesson to successfully meet course deadlines.</p></li>
            <li><p>A brief explanation of any unique course characteristics.</p></li>
            <li><p>An invitation to access the course promptly and an explanation of what students should do to get started.</p></li>
            <li><p>Remind students that this is not an independent study course, so they need to start completing assignments right away.</p></li>
            <li><p>Provide your contact information, including your BYU-Idaho email address (and a phone number, if you want to provide one).</p></li>
            <li><p>Remind students to use appropriate etiquette and respect in their interactions with instructors and students.</p></li>
            <li><p>Holding an office hour is optional. If you intend to hold an office hour, invite students to attend, and provide instruction on how to find your virtual office.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Be sure to add your own personal flare to your welcome email. Below is a sample email template which you may find useful.</p>
        <div class="textSmall">
            <p>Dear Students,</p>
            <p>Welcome to <span class="r">[course name]</span>! My name is <span class="r">[your name]</span>, and I will be your instructor this semester. I am looking forward to getting to know you and working with you as we ....... <span class="r">[Add a personal experience or vision for this subject—why do you see this class as important?]</span></p>
            <p>Because this is a <span class="r">[enter the number of credits]</span> credit class, you are expected to spend an average of <span class="r">[enter the number of hours]</span> hours to complete course work each lesson. The semester will begin on <span class="r">[insert date]</span>, but you are invited to view the course now to familiarize yourself with it.</p>
            <p>You can access the course by logging into I-Learn (Links to an external site.) and selecting our class. Please read the course syllabus for more information about the course and assignments. Then open and begin the first lesson. Remember, this is not an independent study course, so you will need to follow the due dates posted online.</p>
            <p><span class="r">[It is not an expectation for you to hold weekly office hours. Should you choose to do so, you can use this paragraph content. Delete this paragraph if you choose not to use office hours.]</span> Each lesson, I will hold an office hour on <span class="r">[insert day of lesson and time, including time zone]</span>. I highly recommend that you attend the session and bring your questions. (On the course Overview page, you can find the link to my virtual office.) During this time, I will be available to answer any questions you might have and discuss the current assignments.</p>
            <p>I hope each of you know that even though this course is online, I am available to answer your questions and concerns. Please feel free to email me at <span class="r">[abc123456@byui.edu]</span> or call me at <span class="r">[(555) 555-5555]</span>. <span class="r">[(You are not required to provide a telephone number.)]</span> I will reply to you as soon as I can.</p>
            <p>I am looking forward to our time together this semester. Remember to use appropriate etiquette and respectful communication with me and with your classmates throughout the semester.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p><span class="r">[Your name]</span></p>
