                <h3>Pagination</h3>
                <p>What is pagination?</p>
                <p>Let's think about the following data: </p>
                <img src="lesson08_01.jpg" alt="" class="img-tutorial">
                <p>When paginating data, you can have the server drive it or the client. When decided how to do this, here are some things to consider: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>How complex is the data? The more complex the data is or more connections it has to other tables in a database, the slower retrieving the data from the database will be. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>How large is the dataset? A larger dataset means more data is being sent to the client.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>How is the main audience going to interact with the data?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>How often will they be searching and sorting? For someone who is interacting with the data frequently, the more the Client has to request the data from the server.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Summing everything up...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>If the data is simple and easily managed - paginate on the client.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If the data is complex, large, or has the potential to become so in the near future - take the time to set up server-side pagination</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Client-side Pagination Example</h4>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Students should begin building their project</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Remind students that there are platforms to check the current state of the project's API calls. One greate resource to use is <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a></p>

                <h3>Class Activity</h3>
                <p>To help students gain experience working with using async requests to update the DOM, here is a class activity. The following zip file can be distributed to your students. It has tasks in it instructing them regarding what they should do. This can be done in a class setting as a group, in teams, or individually. </p>
