                    <li><p>Post an announcement for your students this week in Teams.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Check in on your students. See if any need help to get caught up. See if any new students added your course late.</p></li>

                <h2>Teaching Notes</h2>
                <p>Important topics to teach your students this week. These topics will come primarily from the reading and should contain information that will help them with their assignments. </p>
                <h3>Review the Project Template</a></h3>
                <p>Students will be working in this project quite a bit. The better they understand it, the more successful they will be in the course.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><a href="https://github.com/byui-cse/cse341-project" target="_blank">Project Template Link</a></p></li>
                    <li><p>What all is going on in index.js?</p></li>
                    <li><p>How do the routes work?</p></li>
                    <li><p>How do the ejs pages get loaded?</p></li>
                    <li><p>What is the package.json?</p></li>
                    <li><p>What is the public directory used for?</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Templating Engines</h3>
                <p>Students will be working with Template engines this entire semester. The majority of it will be in EJS but they can use a different engine if they like. Help them understand the following concepts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Template engines are simply a way to create what is essentially a dynamic html document.</p></li>
                    <li><p>There are many different template engines. Some of the more common template engines include Pug, Mustache, EJS, Handlebars, DoT.js, NunJucks, Underscore, ECT, Hogan, Dust.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The Academind course will show many examples in Pug and Handlebars, but the majority of the videos and cse341 as a whole will be using EJS. </p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Working with EJS</h3>
                <p>Why are we going to focus on <a href="https://ejs.co/" target="_blank">EJS</a>?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Use plain JavaScript</p></li>
                    <li><p>Speedy execution</p></li>
                    <li><p>Fast development time</p></li>
                    <li><p>Easy debugging</p></li>
                    <li><p>Simple syntax</p></li>
                    <li><p>Active development</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Show them some examples of how ejs looks. You could use the project template, or other code. But help them understand that that can write plain html, and then insert ejs tags anywhere they want/need to execute JavaScript.</p>
                <img src="lesson02_1.jpg" alt="" class="img-tutorial">
                <p>With the examples above, it would also be helpful to show where the <code>title</code> variable is coming from when the ejs file is being rendered:</p>

                <h3>Class Activity</h3>
                <p>To help students gain experience working in Node, here is a class activity. The following zip file can be distributed to your students. It has tasks in it instructing them regarding what they should do. This can be done in a class setting as a group, in teams, or individually. </p>
                <h4><a href="lesson02-start.zip">Lesson 2 Class Activity START zip to share with students</a></h4>
                <p>For your reference, here is an example of a completed copy of the class activity:</p>
                <h4><a href="lesson02-completed.zip">Lesson 2 Class Activity COMPLETED zip</a></h4>

                <h2>Instructor Preparation</h2>
                <h4>Student Tasks</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Several hours of videos in the Academind course. They will then complete a short quiz in I-learn.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A team activity. They should work on it for at least an hour before they view the instructor solution. Their completion of this assignment will be reported in I-learn.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A prove assignment which will be completed by each student individually. This prove assignment will also have to be pushed to Heroku. This will be a challenge to set up for some students. The sooner they can get started on creating the heroku project, the better.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Give your students encouragement with the busy schedule and help answer any questions they may have. Do your best to promote a comfortable environment in Microsoft Teams so that students feel comfortable asking questions on a channel where everyone can see it. This will be their first place to receive help most of the semester.</p>
