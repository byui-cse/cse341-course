                <p>Important topics to teach your students this lesson. These topics will come primarily from the reading and should contain information that will help them with their assignments. </p>
                <p>Learning how to manipulate the DOM asynchronously is an incredibly marketable skill that will serve these students well. Among other things that they will learn, our goal is to help them gain experience in this asynchronous functionality. While they have been learning asynchronous Node.js this whole semester, manipulating the DOM can be tricky because the process is a bit different. The class activity for this will be extremely valuable in learning the process of manipulating the DOM without reloading the page. <a href="https://pro.academind.com/courses/767386/lectures/13902304" target="_blank">This Academind Lesson</a> is a helpful start, but we will take it a step further in the class activity.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p></p>

                </ul>
                <h3>Class Activity</h3>
                <p>To help students gain more experience working with async requests to update the DOM, here is a class activity. The following zip file can be distributed to your students. It has tasks in it instructing them regarding what they should do. This can be done in a class setting as a group, in teams, or individually. </p>
                <h4><a href="lesson09-start.zip">Lesson 9 Class Activity START zip to share with students</a></h4>
                <p>For your reference, here is an example of a completed copy of the class activity.There are two example this lesson. Option1 does not re-render the pages. Option2 does. Students are meant to compare and analyze the two of them to learn advantages and disadvantages to both. This is intended to help supplement their learning from last lesson, and help them with their projects.</p>
                <h4><a href="lesson09-completed-option1.zip">Lesson 9 Class Activity COMPLETED zip Option 1 (NO RE-RENDERING)</a></h4>
                <h4><a href="lesson09-completed-option2.zip">Lesson 9 Class Activity COMPLETED zip Option 2 (GET and POST used)</a></h4>

                <h2>Instructor Preparation</h2>
                <p>As students get settled in working on their projects, it may be helpful to schedule a few minutes to meet with each team just to get a feel for how they're doing, and to provide feedback where applicable. An easy way to do this is to set up a calendar showing your availability to your students where they can set up an appointment at time that works for their group...then they don't have to coordinate with you, they just set up the appointment and you guys can meet. <a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank">Calendly</a> is a great resource for this.</p>
                <p>This lesson is all about asynchronous JavaScript. There will be countless opportunities and use cases for asynchronous requests and functionality in web applications. The goal this lesson is to have our students understand well how this process works. They have worked with promises, callbacks, and asynchronous functions in Node quite a bit this semester. This lesson will focus on how to bring that understanding and those concepts to the frontend. </p>
