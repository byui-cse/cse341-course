                            <li>Testing Node.js Applications</li>
                            <li>Node.js as a build Tool & Using npm</li>

                <h3>Socket.io</h3>
                <p>What is Socket.io?</p>
                <p>The following example shows what a Socket.io can accomplish:</p>
                <img src="./socket-chat.gif" class="img-tutorial" alt="Socket.io message example">
                <p>In this example we see a two key characteristics of what socket.io can accomplish:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Real time event based communication</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Bi-directional communication between browser and server</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="./bidirectional-communication.png" class="img-tutorial" alt="Bi-directional communication between browser and server">
                <p>Socket.io allows for the browser/client to be updated without a refresh due to it's communication with the server </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The server listens for changes to the client</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Upon receiving a change it emits the event</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>This updates all clients associated with the server</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>In conclusion...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Socket.io allows for asyncronous communication</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clients do not need to refresh to view changes from a seperate client (i.e messages sent in a messaging application)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Class Activity</h3>
                <p>To help students gain experience using and understanding NPM packages here is an activity where they will implement the CHALK NPM package.
                    The following zip file can be distributed to your students. It has tasks in it instructing them regarding what they should do.
                    This can be done in a class setting as a group, in teams, or individually. </p>
                <p>Students will need the following link for the documentation on the CHALK package:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk">https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk</a></p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Students will create a basic chat room application using socket.io</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>A template will be available to the students as a staring off point</p>
