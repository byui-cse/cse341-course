                <h3>Git and Github</h3>
                <p>Students will create a github account and a new repository this week. For some students, this may be there first time working with git. Help them understand what git and Github are. </p>

                <h2>Instructor Preparation</h2>
                <h4>Student Tasks</h4>
                <p>This is going to be a very important week for the class. Students will: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>have an opportunity to get to know one another in a channel that you create in Teams</p></li>
                    <li><p>have to download software that they'll need throughout the semester</p></li>
                    <li><p>get started in the Academind course</p></li>
                    <li><p>and do their first assignments.</p></li>
                </ul>  
                <h4>Busy Course Disclaimer to give to students</h4>
                <p>It is important that students understand that the first few weeks of this course will be very busy as they learn Node.js and go through the Academind course. This will prepare them for the remainder of the semester where the remainder of the grade will be accounted for.</p>
                <h4>Student Repositories</h4>
                <p>Share with the students that by the end of this week, they will end up with two repositories.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>The project template that they download during the team activity this week will be the location where they put their assignments outside of their projects. So the team activities for the first 6 weeks of the course will all be a part of this Node.js project.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The Academind course starts off from nothing. If students want to include the e-commerce project (weeks 3-6) in their first node project from the template, that is just fine. However, it tends to be more straightforward to keep them separate, because then they can simply follow along with the Academind course without having to worry about route issues or integration.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Syllabus and Grades</h4>
                <p>Regarding their grades, it is important for them to know how they will be graded, and how much weight each assignment carries in the course. Please share the syllabus with them, and point out the extremely large portion of the grade the final project will account for. </p>
                <h4>Teams Throughout the Semester</h4>
                <p>Explain the way the course will work. They will be working in groups through the whole semester. Those groups need to be formed this week. In the first six weeks, they will have team assignments that are independent from one another. Starting in week 7, they will be put in new teams for their final projects. These teams will create an application together and each weekly team activity will simply serve as a way to be accountable, but their primary grade will be derived from their final submission. Some sections of CSE 341 will work with WDD 330 students for the final project. Others will not. Both of these <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse341-course/projectStuff/prj2/" target="_blank">project descriptions</a> are in <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse341-course" target="_blank">the course</a>.</p>
                <h4>Don't fall behind!</h4>
                <p>Help the students understand the importance of not falling behind. There will be several hours of videos to watch/engage in each week at the start of the semester, and for them to finish their first full stack application by week 6, it is crucial that they do not fall behind.</p>
