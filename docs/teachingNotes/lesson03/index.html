                        push their projects up to Heroku.

                <h2>Teaching Notes</h2>
                <p>Important topics to teach your students this week. These topics will come primarily from the reading and should contain information that will help them with their assignments. </p>
                <h3>MVC Pattern</h3>
                <p>Successfully setting up the course project will help the students to have a better
                    understanding of course principles. By understanding the logic behind the MVC Pattern
                    students will more easily understand the principles of the course.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>Model:</b> Explain what is a model and how will it be used in the context of a json file (i.e the prove assignment)</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>View:</b> Why EJS? What are some of the benefits of the various rendering services that Max discusses (EJS, Handlebars, PUG)</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Controller:</b> Help the students to distinguish the difference between the controller and the
                    model. Show how controller functions can be used together with routing to create server logic</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>JSON</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Explain the reason for using JSON data and simply relate it to later use of a NoSQL database</p></li>
                    <li><p>Help the students to understand how data retrieval relates to and is used in the MVC pattern</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Routing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Teach the difference between GET and POST</p></li>
                    <li><p>Help the students understand how these requests are handled in regards to routing</p></li>
                    <li><p>Dynamic routing will be an important concept as it will help the students when displaying
                        product details in their ecommerce projects
                    </p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Class Activity</h3>
                <p>To help students gain experience working in Node, here is a class activity. The following zip file can be distributed to your students. It has tasks in it instructing them regarding what they should do. This can be done in a class setting as a group, in teams, or individually. </p>
                <h4><a href="lesson03-start.zip">Lesson 3 Class Activity START zip to share with students</a></h4>
                <p>For your reference, here is an example of a completed copy of the class activity:</p>
                <h4><a href="lesson03-completed.zip">Lesson 3 Class Activity COMPLETED zip</a></h4>

                <h2>Instructor Preparation</h2>
                <h4>Student Tasks</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Several hours of videos in the Academind course. They will then complete a short quiz in I-learn.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A class activity though there will be no submission of this activity</p></li>
                    <li><p>A team activity. They should work on it for at least an hour before they view the instructor solution. Their completion of this assignment will be reported in I-learn.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A prove assignment allowing the students to implement data retrieval from a JSON file
                        through routing and the use of the MVC pattern. This assignment will be submitted individually 
                        by a link submission the heroku and github urls
                    </p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Give your students encouragement with the busy schedule and help answer any questions they may have. Do your best to promote a comfortable environment in Microsoft Teams so that students feel comfortable asking questions on a channel where everyone can see it. This will be their first place to receive help most of the semester.</p>
