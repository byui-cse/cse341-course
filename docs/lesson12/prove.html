        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>For this lesson's activity, you will create a livechat room using socket.io and sessions. You will be provided a template, and this is easier than it sounds.</p>
        <p>The primary task here is to combine some of your learning from the past semester and create a simple yet very useful web application. While the application does not have a backend, one could be easily implemented.</p>
        <p>Start working with the files located within the zip folder <a href="starter/PR12Starter.zip">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <h4>Core Requirements</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>When a user logs in using the ta12-login.ejs, their username is stored as a session variable. There <strong>cannot</strong> be duplicate usernames. If a user enters a duplicate username, they are notified.</p>
                <img src="images/challenge1.gif">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When a user logs in, other users logged into the chat are notified via an "admin" user.</p>
                <img src="images/challenge2.gif">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When a user sends a message, it is appended to their own chatbox and all other connected users. (basically, the page follows the basic operations of a messaging application) </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This application has a lot of potential for creativity. For example, you could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Include the time a message was sent in the message.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make the messages persistent using MongoDB.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Notify users when a client disconnects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use socket.io rooms (instead of a global chat)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
